\section{Preface}
Recent studies on tunable nano reactors with termosensitive polymer shell have shown curious effects in reaction rates.
The state of the shell is presumalbly fluctuating between states with different permeability for the substrate.
To investigate on this effect a simplified system of diffusing particles in the vicinity of a spherical sink shielded by a metastable potential barrier is investigated. We derive an implicit solution for the resulting Fokker-Planck equation to obtain the diffusion controlled reaction rate and verify these results with brownian dynamics simulations. The system shows resonant activation as previously seen with thermally activated escape over fluctuating barriers.\\

\section{Preface}
Recent studies on tunable nano-reactors with a thermosensitive polymer shell have shown curious effects in reaction rates
right at the polymer critical solution temperature.
The shell is presumably stochastically fluctuating between states with different permeability for the substrate.
To investigate this effect a simplified system of diffusing particles in the vicinity of a spherical sink shielded by a metastable potential barrier is investigated. We derive an implicit solution for the resulting Fokker-Planck equation to obtain the diffusion-controlled reaction rate and verify these results with Brownian dynamics computer simulations. The system shows resonant activation as previously seen with thermally activated escape over fluctuating barriers.

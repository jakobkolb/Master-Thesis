@article{Dzubiella2005,
abstract = {The Smoluchowski approach to diffusion-controlled reactions is generalized to interacting substrate particles by including the osmotic pressure and hydrodynamic interactions of the nonideal particles in the Smoluchoswki equation within a local-density approximation. By solving the strictly linearized equation for the time-independent case with absorbing boundary conditions, we present an analytic expression for the diffusion-limited steady-state rate constant for small substrate concentrations in terms of an effective second virial coefficient B2*. Comparisons to Brownian dynamics simulations excluding hydrodynamic interactions show excellent agreement up to bulk number densities of B2*rho0 < approximately = 0.4 for hard sphere and repulsive Yukawa-like interactions between the substrates. Our study provides an alternative way to determine the second virial coefficient of interacting macromolecules experimentally by measuring their steady-state rate constant in diffusion-controlled reactions at low densities.},

@article{Reimann2000,
abstract = {We consider the thermally activated escape of an overdamped Brownian particle over a potential barrier in the presence of periodic driving. A time-dependent path-integral formalism is developed which allows us to derive asymptotically exact weak-noise expressions for both the instantaneous and the time-averaged escape rate. Our results comprise a conceptually different, systematic treatment of the rate prefactor multiplying the exponentially leading Arrhenius factor. Moreover, an estimate for the deviations at finite noise strengths is provided and a supersymmetry-type property of the time-averaged escape rate is verified. For piecewise parabolic potentials, the rate expression can be evaluated in closed analytical form, while in more general cases, as exemplified by a cubic potential, an action-integral remains to be minimized numerically. Our comparison with very accurate numerical results demonstrates an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions over a wide range of driving strengths and driving frequencies.},

abstract = {The Austrian physicist Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann (1844-1906), educated at the University of Vienna, was appointed professor of mathematical physics at the University of Graz in 1869 at the age of only twenty-five. Boltzmann did important work in the fields of statistical mechanics and statistical thermodynamics; for instance, he contributed to the kinetic theory concerned with molecular speeds in gas. Boltzmann also promoted atomic theory, which at the time was still highly controversial. He was a member of the Imperial Austrian Academy of Sciences from 1885 and became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1888. This three-volume work, prepared in 1909 by the physicist Fritz Hasen\"{o}hrl, one of Boltzmann's students, comprises all his academic publications from 1865 to 1905. Volume 1 contains papers from 1865 to 1874, including work on the movement of electricity, the theory of heat, and atoms in gases.},

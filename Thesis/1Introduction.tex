\section{Preface}
Recent studies on tunable nano reactors with termosensitive polymer shell have shown curious effects in reaction rates.
The state of the shell is presumalbly fluctuating between states with different permeability for the substrate.
To investigate on this effect a simplified system containing a spherical sink shielded by a potential barrier is investigated. We derive an implicit solution for the diffusion controlled reaction rate and verify these results with brownian dynamics simulations.\\
\newline
This report contains the necessary spadework namely derivation of analytical solutions for non fluctuating potentials as well as development and testing of a numeric Brownian dynamics simulation of the system.
